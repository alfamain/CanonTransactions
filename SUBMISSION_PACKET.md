# Canon Transactions — owner submission packet

> **Status: owner-closeout template.** This file prepares verifiable links and checks. Only `alfamain` may make owner-authored claims, publish the first-person article/social post, associate their existing owner-specific Walrus Memory account with the entry, and submit the official form.

## Judge path

**Hook:** Recall rank is not current truth.

**Runnable proof:** Run `make test && make demo && make synthetic-stand`; correction, revocation, and conflict produce named resolver outcomes.

**Evolved prompt:** [`PROMPT.md`](./PROMPT.md)  
**Source prompt:** https://github.com/yukitran03/continuity-keeper  
**Deterministic/Mainnet evidence manifest:** [`replay/mainnet-receipts.json`](./replay/mainnet-receipts.json)  
**Article draft:** [`ARTICLE.md`](./ARTICLE.md)  
**Source feedback draft:** [`ISSUE.md`](./ISSUE.md)  
**Video runbook:** [`JUDGE_RECORDING.md`](./JUDGE_RECORDING.md)

## Evidence boundary

The ledger stand is a fixed, committed replay graph. It verifies the resolver's lifecycle behaviour separately from the receipt manifest.

## Owner-only finalization

1. Re-run the listed local command and review the prompt, evidence manifest, and all claims.
2. Publish the content of `ISSUE.md` as feedback in the **original source repository**; paste its URL here: `SOURCE_ISSUE_URL`.
3. Review, adopt, and publish the first-person article only if every first-person factual statement is true; paste: `ARTICLE_URL`.
4. Publish an owner-authored X/social post linking the article and repository; paste: `SOCIAL_POST_URL`.
5. Use the owner's existing owner-specific Walrus Memory account as this entry's dedicated Sessions wallet. Record only its public address: `SESSIONS_WALLET_ADDRESS`. Add `OWNERSHIP_PROOF_URL` only if the official form requires public ownership proof; do not create or switch wallets for this checklist.
6. Record the completed video URL: `VIDEO_URL`. It must show baseline → evolved guard → assertion → receipt-board boundary, with no credentials or cost-bearing live write.
7. Submit one official Session 7 form under the owner identity only after the fields above are reviewed. Record `Airtable submission URL/confirmation` and `WalForm submission URL/confirmation` if both are required by the event.

## Pre-submit gate

- [ ] Owner identity and the existing owner-specific Walrus Memory account (the dedicated Sessions wallet) are correctly associated with this entry.
- [ ] Original-source issue is publicly posted and linked.
- [ ] Article and social post were personally reviewed/adopted by the owner.
- [ ] Video speaks only to demonstrated layers and visibly states the limitation.
- [ ] Receipt wording says “committed manifest” unless a fresh terminal run and independent read are documented.
- [ ] Exactly one final submission is made by this owner.
